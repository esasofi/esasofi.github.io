Change about:
change the text in [index.md](https://github.com/esasofi/esasofi.github.io/blob/main/index.md) 

the file is in the root folder, you can see it from here, but for accessibility easing i put a link.

1. in the right above the text, press the little pen button, which is edit
2. edit the text, everything is done in [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

   pay attention to the markdown rules, for example, if u put anything between parentheses the parentheses will dissappear and the text will become a link

   in the left above the text, u can press the preview button to see how the text will look
4. when ready, press the green commit button
5. put some text in the commit message, can be any u want, it is for referencing a change, extended description is not manditory, only if u want
6. press commit changes - It will now automattically update ur website.
