# About

Sof√≠a Malacalza, also known as EsaSofi, is a creative researcher and visual artist, born in Buenos Aires and based in Amsterdam and Barcelona. With studies in photography at the Escola Fotoespai in Barcelona and at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in The Hague, she explores the boundaries of digital art, combining her photographic vision with the technique of video projection to create unique visual experiences. Her practices include VJing, Live Performance, videomapping, set design, digital photography, and installations.

Through the DiCEM Master's program at UPF in Barcelona, Sofia gained academic knowledge to conduct research projects. In her thesis, 'Sound Collage,' a collaborative project, she combines academic research with techniques of videomapping and audiovisual collage.

For Sofia, the audiovisual dissemination of academic research makes knowledge more accessible. She considers videomapping to be an innovative medium that can convey complex narratives. Passionate about collaborative artistic projects, her focus is on gender diversity in the arts and technical roles. 
Through her work, Sofia seeks to engage the senses, promoting inclusivity and collective work.
